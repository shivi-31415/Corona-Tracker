      A COVID-19 positive patient can open the web app at
       
      https://demo.trackcovid.net
      . 
      The patient should open the "Status" tab, and press "Download Checkpoints". This will download a file to the patient's phone, which the patient can email to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have the file, you may upload it using the button below. Please select the estimated date of symptom onset before uploading the file. (Contacts 2 days prior to symptom onset, and 14 days after, will be notified.)
